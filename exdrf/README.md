# Datasets-Resources-Fields

The library allows the user to define fields that make up a resource that is
part of a dataset. The purpose is to construct an unified interface for
describing these concepts, with supporting libraries for deriving the
tree from various sources (e.g. SqlAlchemy, Pydantic, etc.) and for
generating content from the tree.
